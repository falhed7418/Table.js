Table.js
===========

A tiny library to generate and search through a list.



With Table.js you are able to use a dependency-free javascript library to search through big arrays and present them by using a template.
A more detailed description and tutorial will follow soon.


Take a look at the (rudimentary) example to see how it works.

Please notice that Table.js has not been tested in production. If you notice any bugs, please let me know.
